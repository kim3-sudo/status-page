# Contributing

Hi! I'm glad you're here to contribute! This is very much a homebrew project, but it's designed to be very hackable and extendable.

Contributions to the project are released to the public under the project's [MIT license](https://github.com/kim3-sudo/status-page/blob/main/LICENSE).

This project is also dictated by a code of conduct. By contributing, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Making and requesting changes

1. Make a fork of the repository and set up a local build.
2. Create a new branch and make your change to your branch.
3. Merge your new branch with the main branch of your repository (essentially, PR to yourself).
4. Submit a pull request to this repository.
5. :tada:

## Issues

Issues largely fall into two categories: things that are broken and things that are missing. If you notice something that's broken, please submit it in a GitHub issue so it can be tracked down and resolved, even if you don't know how to fix it. If you'd like to build new modules or functionality into the software, that's something that's missing. The code's pretty bare, so if you'd like to do this, by all means go ahead!
